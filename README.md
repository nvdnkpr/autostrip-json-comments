install:

```
npm install autostrip-json-comments --save
```

use:

```javascript
require('autostrip-json-comments');

var obj = require('path/to/commented-json-filename');
// comments are automatically stripped inside require
```



## Why?

Because stripping comments from ALL json files should be automatic.

Uses [strip-json-comments](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments) internally.
